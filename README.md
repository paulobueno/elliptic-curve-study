# elliptic-curve-study
The main objective of this repository is to gather knowledge about elliptic curve used in Bitcoin protocol.<br>
1. Create functions that calculate data point's sum operations
2. Use these functions and Bitcoin's parameters to calculate a Public Key based on a Private Key
3. Understand the efort to simply create a relational database of Private Vs Public keys
<br>
Study mainly based on the book [Mastering Bitcoin](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/mastering-bitcoin/9781491902639/).
